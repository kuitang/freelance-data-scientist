# Experiments in Claude
I haved been trying to build an automatic data science agent, and I saw [this article](https://dwyer.co.za/static/claude-code-is-all-you-need.html) by a Gareth and was tempted to adopt it to fit my needs.

Instead of a "startup", I made it take a more moderate task of finding a dataset and analyzing it. The whole thing in under 20 minutes if you can believe.

I blatantly stole CLAUDE.md from dweyer (link above) and asked Claude to revise it to my needs. Surprising how well it worked.

Claude only crashed once with some EPERM trying to access google cloud. I have no idea what it was trying to run... maybe that was a bit dangerous lol.
