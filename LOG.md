# Analysis Log

## 2025-08-16 (Current Session)

### System Initialization
**Time**: 2025-08-16 (session start)
**Action**: System initialization and status file creation
**Status**: Completed
**Details**: Created all required status files for autonomous data science analysis system

### Dataset Discovery
**Time**: 2025-08-16 (post-initialization)
**Action**: Dataset Discovery Agent executed
**Status**: Completed
**Details**: Found 5 high-quality small datasets including Palmer Penguins, World Happiness Report 2024, COVID-19 Vaccination Progress, Global Temperature Anomalies, and Netflix content data. All datasets are < 10MB, ethically sourced, and suitable for analysis.

### Dataset Selection
**Time**: 2025-08-16 (post-discovery)
**Action**: Selected Palmer Penguins Dataset for analysis
**Status**: Completed
**Details**: Chose Palmer Penguins dataset due to excellent documentation, perfect size (~30KB, 344 observations), and strong analytical potential for species classification and morphological analysis.

### Data Analysis Execution
**Time**: 2025-08-16 (analysis phase)
**Action**: Code Development Agent created comprehensive analysis script
**Status**: Completed
**Details**: Generated penguins_analysis.py with full exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, and 4 visualizations. Analysis reveals strong correlation between flipper length and body mass (r=0.871), clear species differences, and significant sexual dimorphism across all measurements.

### Visualization Generation
**Time**: 2025-08-16 (analysis phase)
**Action**: Generated 4 comprehensive visualizations
**Status**: Completed
**Details**: Created species comparison boxplots, correlation heatmap, flipper-mass scatter plot, and sexual dimorphism violin plots. All images saved as PNG files for report inclusion.
